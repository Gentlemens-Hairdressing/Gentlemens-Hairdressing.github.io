I know everyone is excited about getting an appointment as soon as they can as we all look like shaggy dogs, but first I need to check what precautions that the government have put in place to protect staff and how to incorporate them in to a workable booking system, I'll be spending rest of week doing this and I'll be at the shop ready to start taking appointments from Monday 29th of June at 9am till 4pm ether by phone or I will most likely have the door open to take appointments in person, I'll be there 9am till 4pm all week apart from Thursday. It would help greatly if you could ring the shop or pop over for your appointment as this is easier to sort out than text and messages, thanks. See ya soon and stay safe x😁😁😁😊😊😊"
